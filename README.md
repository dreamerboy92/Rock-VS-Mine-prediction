Rock vs Mine Prediction 🎯
This project is a binary classification model to predict whether an object is a Rock or a Mine using sonar signal data. The dataset contains sonar readings bounced off different surfaces, and the model helps classify the object based on those readings.

🔍 Problem Statement
Sonar returns can help distinguish between rocks and mines. Each object is represented by 60 numerical features corresponding to sonar signal strengths. The task is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify the object as a Rock or a Mine.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)

Jupyter Notebook

🚀 Workflow
Load and explore the dataset

Data preprocessing

Train-test split

Model training (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest)

Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

Model deployment (optional)

📌 Results
The model predicts whether an object is a rock or a mine based on sonar data with good accuracy. It can be useful in real-world applications such as underwater object detection.
